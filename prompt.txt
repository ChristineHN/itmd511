I studied biology but recently got interested in data science. What career path should I take?

I like solving problems and collaborating in teams, but I’m not sure what tech role fits me.

I’ve been doing QA testing but want to move into development. Where should I start?

I’m passionate about cloud technologies and system reliability.

I want a tech career that mixes creativity and logic.
